# üá™üá∫ ‚ùÑÔ∏è EUVlok

__EU__ stands for the European Union, while __Vlok__ comes from the Dutch word
for "flake".

When choosing the name for this repository, we focused on three factors:

1. It should be short
2. It should relate to the EU
3. It should include some Dutch elements

We chose a Dutch word because NixOS was created in the Netherlands by [Eelco
Dolstra](https://edolstra.github.io/). Additionally, the Netherlands is a
strong supporter of the EU, shares its values, and has close ties to both Nix
and NixOS.

----

## üëãüèª üë• Welcome to our communal repository

As friends, we've decided to create this shared repo where we will store
our dotfiles. This endeavor is more than just a convenient place to keep
our dotfiles. It's a shared commitment to __deepen our understanding of Nix and
collectively learn and grow.__

We frequently discuss Nix and share new programs with each other. Previously,
our repositories were separate, which made instant sharing difficult.

Now, we can immediately access the [modules](/modules/) folder to share
our latest findings. Also, we can easily tap into each other's dotfiles to
experiment with and adopt opinionated settings that we like.

Beyond the immediate benefits of sharing _(between ourselves)_, a core motivation
for this communal repository is our ambition to truly push Nix to its limits.
Crafting an isolated Nix configuration tailored to a single individual is
_relatively easy_, you can take as many shortcuts as you like, and design
choices be damned. ___We, however, aspire to the opposite.___

We want to cultivate a shared "system," so to speak, that is not only robust and
highly maintainable, but also serves as a practical demonstration of advanced,
collaborative testament to what can be done with Nix.

----

## ü§ùüèª ü§≤üèª Open Hands, Open Code

_Sharing is the core motivation behind this repo._ Every single line here was
made possible by the broader community of Nix users, most of whom have chosen to
make their work publicly available for everyone.

All of us have practically learned _EVERYTHING_ from reading both official
and unofficial Nix docs, spending countless hours looking at Nixpkgs source
code, following PRs and issues, and reading discussions on "NixOS Discourse."
By casually exploring and sharing knowledge within the Nix community, we have
collectively improved our understanding of Nix, which has helped us build more
advanced and "detailed" Nix setups.

Now, we believe it is the appropriate time to give back to the community.
Although some of our code is specifically tailored for our own use, we are
confident that substantial portions‚Äîespecially the opinionated sections
and custom generic functions for modules‚Äîwill be still useful to anyone who
discovers this repo.

----

## ü§î üîç What do I look for?

We think that you'll find the most use out of the [modules](/modules/) folder;
it contains all of the module bases we use and extend in our configs.

We also think that you will find value in [pkgs](/pkgs/); it contains a custom
derivation for packages that do not exist on `nixpkgs`. It's very likely you
ended up in this repo because of this folder!
