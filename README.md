# üá™üá∫ ‚ùÑÔ∏è EUVlok

__EU__ represents the European Union, while __Vlok__ is derived from the Dutch
word for "flake".

Choosing the name took us some time because we really wanted something that
is simple, short, and meaningful. We aimed for a name that resonates with our
technical philosophy and our appreciation for Europe.

We are __strong__ advocates for the European Union and its values. In light
of recent events in the U.S. and the overall global state in 2025 and beyond,
__we believe it is more important than ever to stand by and promote these
principles.__

Some of our friends are outside the EU also share these values. We recognize
that people anywhere in world can hold these beliefs, and we aim to empower and
support them.

We also want to acknowledge that Nix‚Äîits ideas, community, and evolution‚Äîis
__rooted in both European & World Wide ingenuity__. In Dutch, "_Vlok_" comes
from Middle Dutch, meaning "a small, distinct piece". This reflects our
approach: each module, like a small yet essential piece, contributes to a
greater, cohesive whole.

----

## üëãüèª üë• Welcome to our communal dotfiles

All of us use Nix to manage our dotfiles, we constantly learn and grow. Although
we progress at different paces, we often share modules with each other‚Äîsometimes
almost verbatim.

As close friends, we've decided to create a shared repo where we will store
our dotfiles.

We frequently discuss Nix and share new programs with each other. Previously,
our repositories were separate, which made instant sharing difficult.

Now, we can immediately access the [modules](/modules/) folder to share
our latest findings. Also, we can easily tap into each other's dotfiles to
experiment with and adopt opinionated settings that we like.

----

## ü§ùüèª üíñ ü§≤üèª Sharing Is Caring

_Sharing is the core motivation behind this repo._ Every single line here was
made possible by the broader community of Nix users, most of whom have chosen to
make their work publicly available for anyone to study and use freely.

All of us have learned practically _EVERYTHING_ from reading both official
and unofficial Nix docs, spending countless hours looking at Nixpkgs source
code, following PRs and issues, and reading discussions on "NixOS Discourse."
By casually exploring and sharing knowledge within the Nix community, we have
collectively improved our understanding of Nix, which has helped us build more
advanced and "detailed" Nix setups.

Now, we believe it is the appropriate time to give back to the community.
Although some of our code is specifically tailored for our own use, we are
confident that substantial portions‚Äîespecially the opinionated sections
and custom generic functions for modules‚Äîwill be still useful to anyone who
discovers this repo.

----

## ü§î üîç What do I look for?

We think that you'll find the most use out of the [modules](/modules/) folder;
it contains all of the module bases we use and extend in our configs.

We also think that you will find some value in [pkgs](/pkgs/); it contains
"recipes," so to speak, for more niche but useful "packages" that you might
find interesting. It might even be the reason you ended up on this repo to begin
with!

A notable example would be the `mkExt` function we have for VSCode; it allows
us to very easily and quickly declare an extension in one line without being
super verbose.

For example witohut `mkExt` we would have to write this:

```nix
author.extension = (inputs.nix-vscode-extensions.extensions.${osConfig.nixpkgs.hostPlatform.system}.forVSCodeVersion
pkgs.vscode.version).author.extension;
```

But with `mkExt` we can just simple do:

```nix
(mkExt "author" "extension")
```

Another example would be the `genKeybind` function; we use it for `yazi` (a file
manager). It's a very simple function, _YET_ it saves us so much code. Without
it, we would have to write something like this:

```nix
{
  desc = "Open help";
  on = [ "~" ];
  run = "help";
}
````

But with `genKeybind` we can just simple do:

```nix
(genKeyBind "Open help" [ "~" ] "help")
```

This saves us 5 lines, not a lot by itself, but this scales massively when you
have to define many keybinds, as Yazi does require you to do so

We have a bunch of other small, neat functions that we use to be more brief and
save us from writing a lot of verbose code; after all, this is not Java...
